# ROHM 3-Axis Accelerometer IC KX132ACR-LBZ

KX132ACR-LBZ is an industrial grade 3-axis accelerometer from ROHM. The sensor features include variable ODRs, I2C and SPI control, FIFO with watermark IRQ, wake-up & back-to-sleep events, four acceleration ranges (-2..+2, -4..+4, -8..+8 and -16..+16 g), etc.

### Please note:
The driver had a [scaling bug](https://github.com/RohmSemiconductor/Linux-Kernel-Sensor-Drivers/issues/5) which made it reporting values in micro m/s^2 instead of m/s^2. The fix is integrated to mainline in v6.7-rc7. If you use a kernel older than this, the fix can be found from [here](https://lore.kernel.org/all/ZTEt7NqfDHPOkm8j@dc78bmyyyyyyyyyyyyydt-3.rev.dnainternet.fi/).

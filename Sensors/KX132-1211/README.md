# ROHM/Kionix 3-Axis Accelerometer IC KX132-1211

KX132-1211 is a 3-axis accelerometer from ROHM/Kionix. The KX132-1211 is in many aspects similar to the [KX022A](https://github.com/RohmSemiconductor/Linux-Kernel-Sensor-Drivers/tree/master/Sensors/KX022A) but has an improved FIFO and advanced data path engine.

## Linux:

The upstream KX022A Linux driver which ROHM has developed in collaboration with the Linux kernel community has been modified by Mehdi Daijt to support KX132-1211. Please note that the work done by Mehdi is not officially related to ROHM company. Please, use the regular upstream Linux maintainer information when working with the driver.

The KX132-1211 support was included in the Linux kernel v6.7.

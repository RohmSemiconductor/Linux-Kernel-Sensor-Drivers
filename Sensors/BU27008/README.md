## Linux


The ROHM Finland SWDC has created an IIO driver in collaboration with the
Linux kernel community. Driver is merged to the [upstream Linux](https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git) v6.5.
Support for computing lux values in the driver is being integrated and is currently in
IIO git tree [testing branch](https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/jic23/iio.git/log/?h=testing).
Feature is expected to be merged in upstream Linux v6.7.

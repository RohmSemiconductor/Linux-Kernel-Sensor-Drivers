# The BU27034ANUC ambient light sensor

The original BU27034NUC sensor was redesigned. The new sensor is BU27034**A**NUC.

The ROHM BU27034ANUC is a digital Ambient Light Sensor IC with IÂ²C bus interface. This IC can be used for obtaining ambient light data for example for adjusting LCD and backlight power of TV and mobile phone. It is capable of detecting a very wide range of illuminance.

## Linux Driver

The old BU27034NUC upstream driver code was re-written to support the new BU27034ANUC variant.
The patches converting the old driver to work with the new sensor variant were first merged in the Linux v6.12-rc1 in [the Linux tree](https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git). Please note that the old upstream device driver is **not** working with the new sensor. Also, the new driver will not work with the old sensor. The device-tree compatible was also changed to reflect this. Changes are expected to be officially relased at Linux v6.12.

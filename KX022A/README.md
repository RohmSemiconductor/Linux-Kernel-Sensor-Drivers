## Linux:

The ROHM Finland SWDC is creating an IIO driver in collaboration with the Linux kernel community. Driver is currently being reviewed by the kernel community. An unofficial development version of the driver can be found from [ROHM git](https://github.com/RohmSemiconductor/Linux-Kernel-Sensor-Drivers/releases/tag/kx022a-6.1-rc1-patvh-v4-unofficial-unsupported) but please note that this is likely not the final version and will not be maintained. Stay tuned for the information updates regarding the driver upstreaming process for availability of community supported driver.

# ROHM/Kionix 3-Axis Accelerometer IC KX132-1211

KX132-1211 is a 3-axis accelerometer from ROHM/Kionix. The KX132-1211 is in many aspects similar to the [KX022A](https://github.com/RohmSemiconductor/Linux-Kernel-Sensor-Drivers/tree/master/KX022A) but has an improved FIFO and advanced data path engine.

## Linux:

The upstream KX022A Linux driver which ROHM has developed in collaboration with the Linux kernel community has been modified by Mehdi Daijt to support KX132-1211. Please note that the work done by Mehdi is not officially related to ROHM company. Please, use the regular upstream Linux maintainer information when working with the driver. The upstreamiong process is ongoing. You can find the v8 of Mehdi's patches [here](https://lore.kernel.org/all/cover.1692824815.git.mehdi.djait.k@gmail.com/).
